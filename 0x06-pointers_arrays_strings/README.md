* 0-strcat.c: concatenates two strings.
* 1-strncat.c: concatenates two strings.The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes. Return a pointer to the resulting string dest.
* 2-strncpy.c: copies a string.
* 3-strcmp.c: compares two strings.
* 4-rev_array.c:reverses the content of an array of integers.
* 5-string_toupper.c: changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
